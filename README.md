# AI Privacy Checklist
## Introduction
This list can be used as starting point when defining your own checklist for auditing and evaluating AI systems. It's not a complete coverage of all privacy aspects, and does not cover, for example, cyber security aspects.

There are commercial solutions available to perform evaluations of AI systems, but a lot can be already achieved with simple checklists. 

You are welcome to provide additions and suggestions.
